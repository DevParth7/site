  <h2> What is Web Design?</h2>
<h3> Design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. 
    <br>It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. 
    <br>Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.

<br>A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.

<br>Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are responsive and adaptive design. 
<br>In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen sizes.
 <br>Preserving a layout that is as consistent as possible between devices is crucial to maintaining user trust and engagement. As responsive design can present difficulties in this regard, designers must be careful in relinquishing control of how their work will appear. 
<br>If they are responsible for the content as well, while they may need to broaden their skillset, they will enjoy having the advantage of full control of the finished product.</h3>

<h2>What is User Experience and User Experience Design?</h2>
<h3>To start with, let’s have a brief introduction to what we mean by “User Experience”.<br> Products have users, and the user experience (UX) is simply the experience a user has from using that particular product. So far, so good?

 <h3>  
     <br> UX design is the art of designing products so that they provide the optimum possible user experience.<br> If this description sounds broad, it’s because the nature of UX design is pretty broad. 
   <br>Building the optimum UX encompasses an understanding of psychology, interaction design, user research, and many other disciplines, but on top of it all is an iterative problem solving process (but more on that later).
   <br> Broadly speaking, user experience can be broken down into 3 components: the look, feel, and usability.</h3>
 <h3>  <br>The look of a product is about using visuals to create a sense of harmony with the user’s values, and that creates credibility and trust with the user. 
   <br>It’s about creating a product that not only looks nice, but looks right too.

   <br>The feel, then, involves making the experience of using a product as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. 
   <br>It’s built by crafting the interactions between the user and the product, as well as the reactions they have when (and after) using the product.
   
   <br>Lastly, usability underpins the user experience. Quite simply, if a product isn’t usable, no amount of good looks can salvage it, and the only feeling users are going to have is anger and frustration. Ideally, products should be personalized to user’s needs, and deliver functionality in a predictable way.
